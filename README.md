## How to use my Cat API
 * To grab ALL cats: `http :3000/api/v1/cats/`
 * To grab cats by id: `http :3000/api/v1/cats/-insertCatId`
 * To post a new cat `echo '{"name":"catName"}' | http :3000/api/v1/cats`
 


## Server Endpoints
### `/api/resource-name`
* `POST` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a post request to create a new resource

### `/api/resource-name/:id`
* `GET` request
  * should pass the id of a resource through the url endpoint to get a resource
    * **this should use `req.params`, not querystring parameters**
* `PUT` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a put request to update a pre-existing resource
* `DELETE` request
  * should pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to delete a resource
    * **this should use `req.params`**

### Tests
* create a test that will ensure that your API returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* create a series of tests to ensure that your `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
  * `GET` - test 200, returns a resource with a valid body
 * `GET` - test 404, respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `PUT` - test 200, returns a resource with an updated body
 * `PUT` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no request body was provided
 * `PUT` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no request body was provided
 * `POST` - test 200, returns a resource for requests made with a valid body

### Bonus
* **2pts:** a `GET` request to `/api/resource-name` should return an array of stored resources
