In my models directory I created my mongoose schema called Sushi in my mongo database. To run open up a terminal and call the command mongod --dbpath=./db then open up another terminal and call mongo. Then in my routes directory I have my routes where I handle creating a resource. Making a get request with no id provided to get all made resources or with the provided id to get that certain resource. Then I have a put route that updates the body of the id that you provide in the request. Then I have a delete route to delete a resource.
